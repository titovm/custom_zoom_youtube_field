The **Custom Zoom and YouTube Field** Module for Drupal allows content creators to embed links to Zoom meetings and YouTube videos within Drupal entities, such as nodes or blocks. This module is particularly useful for sites that host virtual events or educational content, providing users with direct links to live sessions or related video content.

**Key Features:**

1. **Dual Link Functionality:**
- **Zoom Link:** Users can input a direct link to a Zoom meeting. This link is displayed when there is no YouTube link provided or if the YouTube link field is left empty.
- **YouTube Link:** Users can also input a YouTube link. When a YouTube link is provided, it takes precedence over the Zoom link and is displayed in a modal window with an embedded YouTube player.
2. **Modal Video Playback:**
- The YouTube link, when clicked, opens in a modal window directly on the page, allowing users to watch the YouTube video without leaving the site. This modal can be closed by clicking a close button or by clicking outside the modal area on the overlay.
3. **Responsive Design:**
- The modal window is responsive, adjusting its size for optimal viewing on different devices, including mobile phones, ensuring a user-friendly experience across all platforms.
4. **Enhanced User Interaction:**
- Users can close the modal by clicking outside the modal window (on the darkened overlay area), enhancing the usability of the modal functionality.
